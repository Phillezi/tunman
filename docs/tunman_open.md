## tunman open

Open a tunnel to a remote target

### Synopsis

The open command allows you to open a single or multiple tunnels to a specified ssh target. 
This target can be specified using the familiar syntax of ssh (<user>@<host>:<port>) with a combination of flags, for example --user or --port, 
things specified with flags take priority. You can also refer to custom hosts specified within your ssh config file (~/.ssh/config),
this config will be read and parsed to open the ssh connection, it even works with proxy-jumps.

Specifying ports to "publish" takes inspiration from how it is done within the docker cli, using -p or --publish per pair you want to publish and ":" as a delimiter.
Bind addresses are optionally specified, if omitted they default to 0.0.0.0.

```
tunman open [target] [flags]
```

### Examples

```
tunman open testserver -p 8080:8080 -p 9090:7070 -p 5050:10.0.12.1:5050 -p localhost:4040:4040
# The command above will look up testserver in the users (the user running the daemon) ~/.ssh/config and open a tunnel
# it will then forward the published port address combinations that are specified

tunman open root@localhost:2222 -p 8080:8090
# The command above will open a tunnel and forward port 8090 inside the ssh host to 8080 of the host running the command.
```
