## tunman close

Close a tunnel or multiple tunnels by ID or all

### Synopsis

The close command is used to terminate active tunnels previously opened by the daemon.
You can close a specific tunnel or multiple tunnels by providing their IDs as arguments. These IDs are printed to stdout when a tunnel is opened.

If you want to close **all** tunnels at once, you can either use the --all flag or pass "all" as the only argument.

Note: Closing all tunnels using the "all" keyword or the --all flag will terminate every active tunnel managed by the daemon.

```
tunman close [ids...] [flags]
```
